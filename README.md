# microservice
1.	Clear instructions for how to REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.

This microservice uses HTTP request and responses as a communication 	pipeline. The server runs locally on localhost:3000/temp and creates 	temp.txt file with values  The user uses the html form to enter the current 	unit, current temperature and new unit. 

2.	Clear instructions for how to RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented.
Local file pulls data from the from local temp.txt file, parses information, computes the converted temperature value and puts it in temp.txt file

3.	UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data work. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand.
